<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cece Duval and I am a Divine Goddess embarking on the adventure of life. Things just keep getting weirder everyday. 
  I like avocado toast with tomato on top. 
  I have a beautiful bernese baby named Mushu who I love and adore. 
  I was raised by a strong independent hispanic woman who inspires me everyday. 
  She has attitude and does not give a single fuck what anyone thinks of her. 
  Recently, I bought her a a shirt for her birthday (because she wanted one very specifically wanted this shirt) that says "In loving memory of when I gave a fuck." 
  She wears this shirt proudly. We love the woman. 
  Okay this is my about me page so back to me but I felt I should mention some of my roots. 
  I love art especially visual arts. I love sailing and I coach during the summers. I worked as a stripper #yesastripper for 3 years and debating going back to it.
  I have tried working vanilla jobs for the past year and where did it land me? Financially unstable, living out of my car and out of a homeless shelter. Fuck that. Everyone thinks ohhhhh you are doing so well. ON THE OUTSIDE.
  The gap in my resume is the only time I was truly financially independent and stable. I want to be on that level again. So here I am learning coding again.
  I am working on developing my skills so that I can create a platform for sex workers online that would allow them to have a space to operate without stigms, judgement, or fear of getting deleted, banned, or losing everything they've worked for overnight.</p>
